# LUFS

Loudness Unit Full Scale (LUFS) is a measurement of the perceptual loudness of
an audio signal. This crate contains a function for computing the loudness of
an audio signal, represented in 32-bit floats and sampled at 48kHz.

I'm not sure that the algorithm is correctly implemented here, but at least it
gives qualitatively half-reasonable results.
